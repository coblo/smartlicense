  fields: {name: Content Blockchain B2C Smart License, description: An easy-to-use
      license construction kit that even legal laypersons can handle, template: "**This
      Content Blockchain Smart License is dedicated to the public domain under the
      [CC0 Public Domain Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode).**\r\n\r\n#
      Content Blockchain B2C Smart License\r\n\r\n## Preface\r\n\r\nToday, professional
      and commercial digital content licensing is a complex issue mostly dealt with
      by specialized lawyers. The idea behind smart licenses is to provide an easy-to-use
      license construction kit that even legal laypersons can handle. In our smart
      license generator any interested rights owner (licensor) can choose from a limited
      number of rights modules. Their combination, supplemented by some standard terms
      and conditions form the content of the smart license, i.e. the use rights, that
      the licensor wants to grant You (the licensee). \r\n\r\nThe smart licenses,
      alongside with basic metadata are publicly registered on the Content Blockchain
      in a secure and reliable, open and transparent, automated and machine-readable
      way.\r\n\r\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this smart license does not apply where
      a license is not needed (e.g. where limitations of copyrights apply like the
      quotation right). Nothing in this license shall be construed as excluding or
      limiting statutory freedoms allowed for by exceptions and limitations, fair
      use, fair dealing and related doctrines.\r\n\r\n**Subject to the terms and conditions
      of this smart license, the Licensor hereby offers You a non-exclusive worldwide
      license for the duration of the copyright to use the licensed material under
      its terms and conditions. By performing the act that the licensor has defined
      as a declaration of acceptance to his offer, You accept and agree to be bound
      by the terms and conditions of this smart license.**\r\n\r\n## 1. Definitions\r\n\r\n**Content
      Blockchain:** Technical system to enable rights owners like **creators** or
      publishers to license content to users and to register the license transactions
      publicly and persistently on a blockchain technology.\r\n\r\n**Creator:** The
      person who created the **licensed material** (e.g. a composer or an author).\r\n\r\n**ISCC:**
      International Standard Content Code - a unique ID (content identifier) that
      defines the **Licensed material** as a machine-readable code.\r\n\r\n**Licensee/You:**
      The individual or entity exercising the rights under this smart license. **Your**
      has a corresponding meaning.\r\n\r\n**Licensed material:** The artistic, scientific
      or literary work, database, or other copyright protected material to which the
      licensor applied this smart license. The licensed material is identified by
      a unique **ISCC**.\r\n\r\n**Licensor:** The individual(s) or entity(ies) granting
      rights under this license. The licensor can be the **creator** or another copyright
      owner (like e.g. a publisher).\r\n\r\n**Rights Module:** A standardized section
      of the **smart license** that describes a certain kind of use. The **licensor**
      can choose from a number of rights modules to define the scope of his/her **smart
      license**.\r\n\r\n**Rights Profile:** The combination of **rights modules**
      the **licensor** chose for his smart license.\r\n**Smart license:** The sum
      of rules that apply for the use of the **licensed material**.\r\n\r\n## 2. Licensing
      conditions\r\n\r\n**You** may use the **licensed material** to the extend and
      under the conditions defined hereafter:\r\n\r\n### 2.1.  Licensed Rights (**rights
      modules**)\r\n\r\n{% for grant in grants %}{{ grant }}{% endfor %}\r\n\r\nAll
      rights that are not mentioned above are reserved.\r\n\r\n### 2.2 Restrictions\r\n\r\n{%
      for restriction in restrictions %}{{ restriction }}{% endfor %}\r\n\r\n### 2.3
      Obligations\r\n\r\n{% for obligation in obligations %}{{ obligation }}{% endfor
      %}\r\n\r\n## 3. Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability\r\n\r\n**Unless
      otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the
      licensor offers the licensed material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations
      or warranties of any kind concerning the licensed material, whether express,
      implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties
      of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement,
      absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of
      errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties
      are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.``\r\n\r\n**To
      the extent possible, in no event will the licensor be liable to you on any legal
      theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct,
      special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other
      losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this smart license or use
      of the licensed material, even if the licensor has been advised of the possibility
      of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability
      is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.**\r\n\r\nThe
      disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be
      interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates
      an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.\r\n\r\n## 4. General Terms
      and Conditions\r\n\r\nThe Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
      terms or conditions.\r\n\r\nTo the extent possible, if any provision of this
      License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum
      extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed,
      it shall be severed from this License without affecting the enforceability of
      the remaining terms and conditions."}
