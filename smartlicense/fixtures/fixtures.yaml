      Content Blockchain B2C Smart License\r\n\r\n{% for rm in rights_modules %}{{
      rm.short_code }}-{% endfor %}Experimental Version 1.0\r\n\r\n## Preface\r\n\r\nToday,
      professional and commercial digital content licensing is a complex issue mostly
      dealt with by specialized lawyers. The idea behind smart licenses is to provide
      an easy-to-use license construction kit that even legal laypersons can handle.
      In our smart license generator any interested rights owner (licensor) can choose
      from a limited number of rights modules. Their combination, supplemented by
      some standard terms and conditions form the content of the smart license, i.e.
      the use rights, that the licensor wants to grant You (the licensee). \r\n\r\nThe
      smart licenses, alongside with basic metadata are publicly registered on the
      Content Blockchain in a secure and reliable, open and transparent, automated
      and machine-readable way.\r\n\r\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this smart license
      does not apply where a license is not needed (e.g. where limitations of copyrights
      apply like the quotation right). Nothing in this license shall be construed
      as excluding or limiting statutory freedoms allowed for by exceptions and limitations,
      fair use, fair dealing and related doctrines.\r\n\r\n**Subject to the terms
      and conditions of this smart license, the Licensor hereby offers You a non-exclusive
      worldwide license for the duration of the copyright to use the licensed material
      under its terms and conditions. By performing the act that the licensor has
      defined as a declaration of acceptance to his offer, You accept and agree to
      be bound by the terms and conditions of this smart license.**\r\n\r\n## 1. Definitions\r\n\r\n**Content
      Blockchain:** Technical system to enable rights owners like **creators** or
      publishers to license content to users and to register the license transactions
      publicly and persistently on a blockchain technology.\r\n\r\n**Creator:** The
      person who created the **licensed material** (e.g. a composer or an author).\r\n\r\n**ISCC:**
      International Standard Content Code - a unique ID (content identifier) that
      defines the **Licensed material** as a machine-readable code.\r\n\r\n**Licensee/You:**
      The individual or entity exercising the rights under this smart license. **Your**
      has a corresponding meaning.\r\n\r\n**Licensed material:** The artistic, scientific
      or literary work, database, or other copyright protected material to which the
      licensor applied this smart license. The licensed material is identified by
      a unique **ISCC**.\r\n\r\n**Licensor:** The individual(s) or entity(ies) granting
      rights under this license. The licensor can be the **creator** or another copyright
      owner (like e.g. a publisher).\r\n\r\n**Rights Module:** A standardized section
      of the **smart license** that describes a certain kind of use. The **licensor**
      can choose from a number of rights modules to define the scope of his/her **smart
      license**.\r\n\r\n**Rights Profile:** The combination of **rights modules**
      the **licensor** chose for his smart license.\r\n**Smart license:** The sum
      of rules that apply for the use of the **licensed material**.\r\n\r\n## 2. Licensing
      conditions\r\n\r\n**You** may use the **licensed material** to the extend and
      under the conditions defined hereafter:\r\n\r\n### 2.1.  Licensed Rights (**rights
      modules**)\r\n\r\n{% for rm in rights_modules.grants %}\r\n\r\n{{ rm.legal_code
      }}\r\n{% endfor %}\r\n\r\nAll rights that are not mentioned above are reserved.\r\n\r\n###
      2.2 Restrictions\r\n\r\n{% for rm in rights_modules.restrictions %}\r\n\r\n{{
      rm.legal_code }}\r\n{% endfor %}\r\n\r\n{% if rights_modules.obligations.exists
      %}\r\n### 2.3 Obligations\r\n\r\n{% for rm in rights_modules.obligations %}\r\n\r\n{{
      rm.legal_code }}\r\n{% endfor %}\r\n{% endif %}\r\n\r\n## 3. Disclaimer of Warranties
      and Limitation of Liability\r\n\r\n**Unless otherwise separately undertaken
      by the licensor, to the extent possible, the licensor offers the licensed material
      as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind
      concerning the licensed material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other.
      This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness
      for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects,
      accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable.
      Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer
      may not apply to You.**\r\n\r\n**Except in the cases of wilful misconduct or
      damages directly caused to natural persons, the licensor will in no event be
      liable for any direct or indirect, material or moral, damages of any kind, arising
      out of the smart license or of the use of the licensed material, including without
      limitation, direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive,
      exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this
      smart license or use of the licensed material damages, even if the licensor
      has been advised of the possibility of such  losses, costs, expenses, or damages.
      However, the licensor will be liable under statutory product liability laws
      as far such laws apply to the licensed material. Where a limitation of liability
      is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.**\r\n\r\nThe
      disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be
      interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates
      an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.\r\n\r\n## 4. General Terms
      and Conditions\r\n\r\nThe Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
      terms or conditions.\r\n\r\nTo the extent possible, if any provision of this
      License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum
      extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed,
      it shall be severed from this License without affecting the enforceability of
      the remaining terms and conditions.\r\n\r\n{% for rm in rights_modules %}\r\n*[{{
